Great, let's build upon the README for Lesson 1 to create the README for Lesson 2. The focus of Lesson 2 will be on further solidifying the foundational knowledge while introducing new, slightly more advanced topics like game loops and event listeners.

# Week 2: 1-on-1 TA Session Ideas

## Overview

Week 2 dives deeper into game development by introducing the game loop and basic event handling. The TA session this week should aim to reinforce these new concepts while ensuring that foundational knowledge from Week 1 is still solid.

## Activity Ideas

### 1. Game Loop Explanation

- **Objective**: Ensure that the student understands the concept and importance of a game loop in game development.
- **Activity**: Review the `start` method in the `Game` class which initializes the game loop. Ask the student to explain how it works in their own words.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - What is a game loop and why is it essential?
  - Can you explain what `requestAnimationFrame` does?

### 2. Event Listener Exercise

- **Objective**: Provide hands-on experience with JavaScript event listeners.
- **Activity**: Create a small project where a button click changes the color of a square on the screen. Make sure to use event listeners.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - How do you add an event listener to an HTML element?
  - Can you think of other events besides 'click'?

### 3. Player Rendering and Positioning

- **Objective**: Reinforce how the `Player` class interacts with the DOM to render the player's position.
- **Activity**: Review the `createElement` method in the `Player` class. Ask the student to modify it to change the player's appearance (e.g., change the color or add a border).
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - How does the `Player` class render the player's element on the screen?
  - How would you go about updating the player's position?

### 4. Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Objective**: Enhance debugging skills, focusing on how to diagnose issues related to the new topics introduced this week.
- **Activity**: Intentionally introduce a small bug in the code (e.g., misspell a variable name). Ask the student to debug it.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - What are your first steps when you encounter an error or unexpected behavior?
  - How can you use the browser's developer tools to assist in debugging?

## Note to TA

These sessions are meant to reinforce the student's understanding and provide additional practice to help the concepts sink in. Feel free to adjust these activities and questions based on the student's progress and learning style.
