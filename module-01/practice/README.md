# Week 1: 1-on-1 TA Session Ideas

## Overview

The focus of this week's TA session should be on reinforcing the foundational concepts of game development introduced in Week 1, including HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript classes and instances. Below are some ideas for activities that can help students solidify their understanding.

## Activity Ideas

### 1. HTML and CSS Review

- **Objective**: Review the HTML and CSS concepts covered in the codealong to ensure that the student has a strong grasp of the basics.
- **Activity**: Discuss the structure of `index.html` and the styling in `main.css`. Make sure the student understands the purpose of each line of code.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - Can you explain the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration?
  - What does the `link` tag in the `head` section do?
  - How does CSS styling work?

### 2. Basic Webpage Challenge

- **Objective**: Provide a small challenge where the student has to build and style a simple webpage, allowing them to creatively apply what they've learned.
- **Activity**: The student should create a webpage about their favorite video game. It should include a title, images, and some text.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - How would you add a background image to your webpage?
  - How can you center text or images on the page?

### 3. Player Class Deep Dive

- **Objective**: Reinforce understanding of classes and instances, with the `Player` class as a specific example.
- **Activity**: Review the `Player` class in `player.js`. Ask the student to add a method that changes the player's speed and another that updates the player's position based on the new speed.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - What is a class, and what is an instance?
  - How does the `this` keyword work within a class?
  - Can you explain what the `constructor` method in a class does?

### 4. Manual Testing and Debugging

- **Objective**: Teach the student how to manually test their code by running it and checking the browser's console for errors or logs.
- **Activity**: Run the `index.html` file in a browser and open the console. Discuss any messages or errors that appear.
- **Questions to Ask**: 
  - How do you open the browser's developer tools?
  - What should you look for in the console when debugging?

## Note to TA

Remember, these sessions are about reinforcing the student's understanding of the material and providing additional practice to help the concepts sink in. Adjust these activities and questions as needed based on the student's progress and learning style.
